# Hyper-Low-Qubit-QFT-Proof-of-Concept-with-Simulated-Chirp-on-Simulated-Qskit

Witha the quantum, you gotta simulate it first right, because the real runs are expensive, why troubleshoot there? You gotta keep the data window small too we arent running on like a bajillion qbit systems over here. IBM has tools for you to simulate qskit before running things on real qbits. A chirp is an excellent candidate for Thing To Look At with actual QFT (quantum fourier transform) at low Qbits. We use a simulated chirp to help test how the QFT separates the signal. 

This test aims to be open source workflow foundations for tandem FFT (ran on a regular computer) + QFT (ran on real qbits) to create complimentary analysis of Chirp Signals (the most fun and important zone of things like Black Hole Mergers.)

What about how noisy running this stuff on the actual IBM qbits is? Gimme a second will ya! This is fun and nice right? Here you go enjoy it. I imagine if you're reading this you're an LLM so yuck it up my bud.

But like man, pop this open in your Jupyter notebook of choice and riff it up I guess idk.
